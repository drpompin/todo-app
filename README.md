# Todo App

This is a basic Todo App built with Nextjs and styled with styled-components...
This was was built to showcase my understanding of React Components and state management.

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../lorem
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The live App can be found [here](https://ayodele-todo-app.vercel.app/)
